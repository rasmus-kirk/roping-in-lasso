                these persons can later find the secret (1 ≤ k ≤ n), whereas
                fewer than k persons get no (Shannon) information about the
                secret. The information rate of the scheme is 1/2 and the
                distribution as well as the verification requires approximately
                2k modular multiplications pr. bit of the secret. It is also

    booktitle = {STOC},
    year = {2008},
    month = {January},
    abstract = {In this work we study interactive proofs for tractable
                languages. The (honest) prover should be eﬃcient and run in
                polynomial time, or in other words a “muggle”.1 The veriﬁer
                should be super-eﬃcient and run in nearly-linear time. These
                proof systems can be used for delegating computation: a server
                can run a computation for a client and interactively prove the
                correctness of the result. The client can verify the result’s
                correctness in nearly-linear time (instead of running the entire
                computation itself). Previously, related questions were
                considered in the Holographic Proof setting by Babai, Fortnow,
                Levin and Szegedy, in the argument setting under computational
                assumptions by Kilian, and in the random oracle model by Micali.
                Our focus, however, is on the original interactive proof model
                where no assumptions are made on the computational power or
                adaptiveness of dishonest provers. Our main technical theorem
                gives a public coin interactive proof for any language computable
                by a log-space uniform boolean circuit with depth d and input
                length n. The veriﬁer runs in time (n+d)·polylog(n) and space
                O(log(n)), the communication complexity is d·polylog(n), and the
                prover runs in time poly(n). In particular, for languages
                computable by log-space uniform NC (circuits of polylog(n) depth)
                , the prover is eﬃcient, the veriﬁer runs in time n · polylog(n)
                and space O(log(n)), and the communication complexity is
                polylog(n).},
